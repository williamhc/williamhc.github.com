title: Blogging is Hard
---

  Today I'm starting what may just be another foolish-and-short-lived-endeavor. I've always enjoyed writing, splatting my thoughts (my ramblings) down on paper. Usually not to be read, but just to be written. And now I am officially starting my very own *blog*.
  
  It seems the first post is always something along these lines and for many, only two or three more posts follow. Why is blogging so hard? It is just your own rambling after all... Maybe it really is that we are just too busy these days, but somehow I don't think so. Maybe we just get lazy. I'll have to blog about it again when I have more experience. 

  Regardless, welcome to my very own corner of the internet. Stay a while and hack on.
